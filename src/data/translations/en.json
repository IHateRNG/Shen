    "descricao1": "In academia, it is possible to analyse a person's capabilities through a tool box metaphor. Let's take me for example: Every time I take a course at my university and learn about a new branch of mathematics, I'm adding a new mathematical tool to my existing mathematical tool box. I'm then able to combine and use the available tools in my mathematical tool box to solve different problems. In League of Legends we can take a similar approach. The usage of the trading tools available to you comprises your trading pattern in the laning phase. After reading this section, you will have acquired three (3) new tools to your trading tool box on Shen. By combining and using these newly-obtained trading tools in game, your Shen gameplay will ascend to another level.",
    "descricao2": "This is an extremely powerful trading tool that can be applied notably well in most melee matchups. To set the Extended Trade up, you need to use Twilight Assault to drag your Spirit Blade to an offensive position before the trade. In general, we consider the Spirit Blade to be in an offensive position when it is deep on the enemy's side of the lane. A defensive Spirit Blade position means that your Spirit Blade is close to your tower or behind you in general. When playing aggressively, always looks for opportunities to drag your Spirit Blade to an offensive position.",
    "descricao21": "To perform the Extended trade, start off by simply using Q to pull the Spirit Blade through your opponent. Now you want to wait for a couple of seconds to let your Q cool down. The 3 empowered Q stacks last for 8 seconds, so you're in no hurry. If the enemy does not respect you, you can simply walk up and start attacking him. After 3 basic attacks, you should position yourself inside of the enemy champion's model to guarantee a second drag-through with your Q. You are almost guaranteed to win the trade if you manage to get all 6 empowered basic attacks off. You can use your E to close the initial gap, to chase for a kill or to disengage after your Qs, depending on the matchup and how the enemy plays it. You should use your W to block the enemy's retaliation attempts during the trade. This trading tool is at its best during the early stages of the laning phase (levels 2-5). Naturally, there is room for variation, i.e. the Extended Trade can be performed from a defensive Spirit Blade position or with any number of initial Q stacks. Always try to adapt the tools to fit the situation presented to you.",
    "descricao3": "In contrast to the aforementioned Extended Trade, that requires some set-up and commitment, the Grasp Chop is a trading tool that can be used from almost all positions and it's very noncommittal by definition. The Grasp Chop is simply one Q-AA with a Grasp of Undying proc. When performed correctly from an offensive Spirit Blade position, the Grasp Chop will trigger the following runes Grasp of the Undying (stay in combat with minions) Shield Bash (activate your Passive with Q) and Cheap Shot (drag-through Q slows). Now that's a lot of damage coming from one (1) basic attack! Performing the Grasp Chop consistently will create a health-advantage for you, which will inevitably lead to kill opportunities with the Extended Trade. The secret behind the success of the Grasp Chop is Ki Barrier. There is no way for the opponent to win short trades versus a perfect grasp-chopping Shen, because you are always shielded when going in for the short trade.",
    "descricao4": "This trading tool is the most situational out of the three. It requires you to have a slow-pushing minion wave that crashes into the enemy tower. To perform the Towercrash Taunt, start by walking up to the opponent under tower and dragging your blade through him thus activating your passive shield. Instead of attacking the enemy champion, simply start attacking his tower. Our goal is to stay in combat to prime Grasp of the Undying. The enemy will most likely attack you and that's the moment you strike: Attack him once with an Empowered Q-AA and then E backwards through him, away from the tower. If done correctly, you will be out of tower range before taking a tower shot.",
    "descricao5": "The Taunt-Flash. This is Shen's most well-known mechanical trick and an iconic part of his kit. To perform the E-Flash, cast Shadow Dash and use  Flash before the dash ends. It's a very simple combo but it can be used in endlessly creative ways. To maximize the range and the area covered by your Shadow Dash's hitbox, you should cast E at maximum range and Flash right before the dash completes. However, maximizing range is not the only correct usage of the Taunt-Flash. You can perform an instant E-Flash by casting Flash immediately after your E. This can be used to catch enemies off-guard from close range and it's especially useful versus a Champion like Fiora, who's always looking to parry your E. I recommend practicing Taunt-Flashing in the Practice Tool before doing it in game. Just play around with the combo by placing multiple Target Dummies and trying to hit them all in creative ways.",
    "descricao6": "A less well-known mechanic, but an equally important one, is the Q-Flash. This trick was first documented by me in 2017 but it has still remained shadows to this day and is outshone by the popular Taunt-Flash. Shen's damage output is greatly increased if you enhance your Q-AAs by pulling your Spirit Blade through an enemy. Getting or not getting the drag-through is often the deciding factor in finishing an enemy off. Pulling the Spirit Blade through an enemy also reduces the cooldown of your  Ki Barrier and can thus, in combination with another ability, save you from otherwise lethal damage. Q-Flashing is the fastest and most reliable method of guaranteeing the drag-through. To perform the Q-Flash, cast Twilight Assault and Flash on top of the enemy champion before the Spirit Blade reaches your location. If you Flash too late, the Spirit Blade will stay at the initial cast point of your Flash. When mastered, this technique will prove valuable in every game you play as Shen.",
    "descricao7": "Shen has one the best Level 1 jungle leashes in the game because of the damage on  Twilight Assault. Most Shen players simply use Q at 1:29 while leashing and then hit 3 Q-AAs on the monster. This is wrong. First, we discovered the Double-Q Leash. To perform the Double-Q Leash, use your first Q at 1:25 and use Q again when you've used the first 3 Q-AAs. The principle is the same as in the Extended Trade. Now, a hasty inference might lead you to think that this is the best possible leash you can give. You would be wrong. Shending Help was the first to document the optimal leashing technique on Shen, the Triple-Q Leash. The Triple-Q Leash adds a Passive shield into the leash and thus supersedes the Double-Q Leash. We manipulate Ki Barrier's cooldown by using Q before the first damaging Q at 1:25. To perform the Triple-Q Leash, use the first Q at 1:17, the second Q at 1:25 and the third Q at 1:34 (after 3 Q-AAs). Use your Passive shield to tank 1 or 2 hits for your Jungler. By doing this correctly, you make your Jungler very happy and arrive to lane in time for the first minion death.",
    "descricao8": "Most Shen players default to using on themselves as if they were playing Jax and using his Counter Strike. During the laning phase, this is correct because you are in fact alone in the top lane. However, when it comes to teamfights and skirmishes, Shen's W should be used to protect your teammates. Spirit's Refuge is an incredibly powerful ability when used correctly. Giving an ADC a two-second immunity to basic attacks can mean the difference between winning and losing a teamfight. The easiest way to apply Spirit's Refuge on a carry is by simply standing next to them, using Q to pull the Spirit Blade there and then using W. In addition to this basic method, there is an advanced way of blocking basic attacks on your teammates. Advanced Q-W Protecting, as I like to call it, is probably the hardest Shen mechanic to perform correctly. It's a situational technique that requires your ally to be standing between you and your Spirit Blade. If you press Q and W at the same time, your Spirit Blade will be primed while moving towards you. When primed, it will activate if it passes through an ally champion, meaning it can also block basic attacks while traveling. An activated, moving Spirit's Refuge will also have a larger instantaneous area of effect than a stationary Spirit's Refuge. This is caused by the check frequency of Spirit's Refuge. The details of this interaction are omitted here for now as they are outside the scope of this guide. See the video below for an example of Q-W Protecting and the larger area of effect."

This is a general tip and is not specific to Shen. It will improve your gameplay on any champion. The second important thing is to move your camera around the map. The minimap gives a whole lot of information, but not everything. To see enemy resource bars, minion health and abilities being used you have to look around the map. There are no excuses to keeping your camera centered on your champion all the time. You need to know what everyone on your team is doing, who is in danger and who is safe. This is vital to your ultimate because you're giving yourself more time to think and make the best decisions. You can either click the map to look around or use the F-keys to view your teammates. I've personally rebound my F-keys to Space for Jungle, V for Mid, C for ADC and X for support. This allows me to quickly check on every teammate with just my thumb while keeping the rest of my fingers on QWER.",
    "WaveManagement": "The state of minion waves has a profound impact on the net present value of Shen's ultimate. It's rarely a good idea to use  Stand United if there is a giant minion wave about to crash into your tower. In the best-case scenario, you would have pushed your minion wave to enemy tower prior to ulting, thus minimizing the amount of minions lost during your absence. Having  Teleport to get back to lane is also ideal. In reality, there are situations where you will have to ult and the wave will not be in a perfect state. But we can minimize our losses by planning ahead. If you can read the state of the game and predict what is likely to happen in the next few minutes, you can setup the minion waves accordingly. Proactive ultimates are great, because they can (by definition) be executed while your wave is pushed up.",
    "CastTiming": " Stand United's shield scales with the target's missing health percentage, maxing out at 60% missing health. The rune Revitalize just so happens to increase shielding on targets below 40% of their maximum health, meaning that the theoretically optimal time to cast your ultimate is when the target ally falls below 40% health. This is good to remember. However, this does not mean that you should only ever cast your ultimate on low-health allies. When timing your ultimate, the deciding factor should be the actions of enemy champions. You want to ult at the moment when the opponent commits to your target ally. Using Stand United is similar to fishing: You don't want to ult too early and scare away the fish, but you also don't want to ult too late when to bait has already been eaten.",
    "Split-pushing": "After the laning phase you'll want to begin split-pushing. Shen excels at split-pushing because he has two ways of joining his team: Teleport and Stand United. Unlike what most people think, the main objective of split-pushing as Shen is NOT to take towers, it is to draw pressure away from your team. Before we start split-pushing, we need either Teleport or Stand United to be off-cooldown, so that we can join our team if needed. Now, I'll briefly explain the three core principles of split-pushing. Mastering these principles will exponentially improve your Shen gameplay and inevitably, your rank as well.",
    "CurrentObjective": "You need to acknowledge what the current objective is and start pushing the opposite side of the map. If it's a neutral objective like Baron, you split-push bot lane. If your team is grouping to take bot Inhibitor, you split-push top lane. You're trying to force the enemies to commit members of their team away from the current objective, so your team either gets the objective uncontested or wins an advantageous team fight. Understanding your team's current objective and eventually win condition is one of the most important skills in League.",
    "MirroringPressure": "We've all seen it happen, a fed toplaner starts split-pushing, dies in a 1v3 and complains that their team doesn't do anything. That toplaner lacks the concept of mirroring pressure. As a split-pusher it is essential to know when your team has pressure and when they don't. When 4 members of your team are sieging a tower, they have pressure and you can mirror that by applying pressure on the opposite side of the map, forcing the enemy into a lose-lose situation. When your team is recalling or just randomly scattered across the jungle, they don't have pressure, meaning you shouldn't try to apply pressure either. If you die when your team has no pressure, the enemy doesn't lose anything. In general, the more aggressive your team is, the more aggressive you can be.",
    "Vision": "As Shen, the worst thing you can do is die in a sidelane for free. Because when you're dead, you can't ult. And when you can't ult, your team is going to int. To prevent this from happening, you'll want to get ward coverage around your lane. Always buy 1 or 2 Control Wards when split-pushing. THIS IS EXTREMELY IMPORTANT. If you don't have space for a Control Ward, sell your Doran's Shield. Use your Stealth Ward and Control Ward to create a line of vision in the jungle. You don't want to extend beyond this line of vision unless you have knowledge of the enemies' positions. Just remember that dying is the last thing you want to do. If hitting the tower puts you at a risk, don't hit it.",
    "StandUnited": "This section will cover the principles of efficient ultimate usage as Shen.  Stand United is a game-changing ability, thus also having a monumental cooldown. Knowing when to ult and when not to, is a major key to climbing the Solo Queue ranks with Shen. An important distinction to make is the difference between reactive and proactive ultimates. Reactive ultimates are performed to counter the enemy's action and to turn the tide of a fight by (usually) ulting a carry in danger. Proactive ultimates are done in collaboration with an engaging ally to pick a fight on our terms, i.e. ulting a stealthed Kha'Zix to assasinate the enemy backline or ulting Jarvan IV that then E-Q's into the enemy team."
