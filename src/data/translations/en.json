    "fingers": "As Shen, you need to be aware of what is happening on the map. Firstly, you need to look at the minimap constantly, atleast once every 5 seconds. This is a general tip and is not specific to Shen. It will improve your gameplay on any champion. The second important thing is to move your camera around the map. The minimap gives a whole lot of information, but not everything. To see enemy resource bars, minion health and abilities being used you have to look around the map. There are no excuses to keeping your camera centered on your champion all the time. You need to know what everyone on your team is doing, who is in danger and who is safe. This is vital to your ultimate because you're giving yourself more time to think and make the best decisions. You can either click the map to look around or use the F-keys to view your teammates. I've personally rebound my F-keys to Space for Jungle, V for Mid, C for ADC and X for support. This allows me to quickly check on every teammate with just my thumb while keeping the rest of my fingers on QWER.",
    "WaveManagement": "The state of minion waves has a profound impact on the net present value of Shen's ultimate. It's rarely a good idea to use  Stand United if there is a giant minion wave about to crash into your tower. In the best-case scenario, you would have pushed your minion wave to enemy tower prior to ulting, thus minimizing the amount of minions lost during your absence. Having  Teleport to get back to lane is also ideal. In reality, there are situations where you will have to ult and the wave will not be in a perfect state. But we can minimize our losses by planning ahead. If you can read the state of the game and predict what is likely to happen in the next few minutes, you can setup the minion waves accordingly. Proactive ultimates are great, because they can (by definition) be executed while your wave is pushed up.",
    "CastTiming": " Stand United's shield scales with the target's missing health percentage, maxing out at 60% missing health. The rune Revitalize just so happens to increase shielding on targets below 40% of their maximum health, meaning that the theoretically optimal time to cast your ultimate is when the target ally falls below 40% health. This is good to remember. However, this does not mean that you should only ever cast your ultimate on low-health allies. When timing your ultimate, the deciding factor should be the actions of enemy champions. You want to ult at the moment when the opponent commits to your target ally. Using Stand United is similar to fishing: You don't want to ult too early and scare away the fish, but you also don't want to ult too late when to bait has already been eaten.",
    "Split-pushing": "After the laning phase you'll want to begin split-pushing. Shen excels at split-pushing because he has two ways of joining his team: Teleport and Stand United. Unlike what most people think, the main objective of split-pushing as Shen is NOT to take towers, it is to draw pressure away from your team. Before we start split-pushing, we need either Teleport or Stand United to be off-cooldown, so that we can join our team if needed. Now, I'll briefly explain the three core principles of split-pushing. Mastering these principles will exponentially improve your Shen gameplay and inevitably, your rank as well.",
    "CurrentObjective": "You need to acknowledge what the current objective is and start pushing the opposite side of the map. If it's a neutral objective like Baron, you split-push bot lane. If your team is grouping to take bot Inhibitor, you split-push top lane. You're trying to force the enemies to commit members of their team away from the current objective, so your team either gets the objective uncontested or wins an advantageous team fight. Understanding your team's current objective and eventually win condition is one of the most important skills in League.",
    "MirroringPressure": "We've all seen it happen, a fed toplaner starts split-pushing, dies in a 1v3 and complains that their team doesn't do anything. That toplaner lacks the concept of mirroring pressure. As a split-pusher it is essential to know when your team has pressure and when they don't. When 4 members of your team are sieging a tower, they have pressure and you can mirror that by applying pressure on the opposite side of the map, forcing the enemy into a lose-lose situation. When your team is recalling or just randomly scattered across the jungle, they don't have pressure, meaning you shouldn't try to apply pressure either. If you die when your team has no pressure, the enemy doesn't lose anything. In general, the more aggressive your team is, the more aggressive you can be.",
    "Vision": "As Shen, the worst thing you can do is die in a sidelane for free. Because when you're dead, you can't ult. And when you can't ult, your team is going to int. To prevent this from happening, you'll want to get ward coverage around your lane. Always buy 1 or 2 Control Wards when split-pushing. THIS IS EXTREMELY IMPORTANT. If you don't have space for a Control Ward, sell your Doran's Shield. Use your Stealth Ward and Control Ward to create a line of vision in the jungle. You don't want to extend beyond this line of vision unless you have knowledge of the enemies' positions. Just remember that dying is the last thing you want to do. If hitting the tower puts you at a risk, don't hit it.",
    "StandUnited": "This section will cover the principles of efficient ultimate usage as Shen.  Stand United is a game-changing ability, thus also having a monumental cooldown. Knowing when to ult and when not to, is a major key to climbing the Solo Queue ranks with Shen. An important distinction to make is the difference between reactive and proactive ultimates. Reactive ultimates are performed to counter the enemy's action and to turn the tide of a fight by (usually) ulting a carry in danger. Proactive ultimates are done in collaboration with an engaging ally to pick a fight on our terms, i.e. ulting a stealthed Kha'Zix to assasinate the enemy backline or ulting Jarvan IV that then E-Q's into the enemy team."
